# Optimized Image Similarity Search and Duplicate Removal
 ## Overview
 
This project an efficient and scalable solution for finding similar images and detecting duplicates within large datasets using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and Bloom Filter techniques. The project is designed to handle large-scale image data, leveraging the power of PySpark for distributed data processing. The focus is on celebrity image datasets, with algorithms optimized for high performance and scalability.

## Features
. Image Similarity Detection: Utilizes the LSH algorithm to find similar images based on their hash values, efficiently grouping visually similar content.

. Duplicate Detection: Implements Bloom Filter to identify and remove duplicate images from the dataset.

. Large Dataset Processing: Efficiently handles and processes large datasets using PySpark's distributed computing capabilities.
Optimized Data Workflows: Optimizes data pipelines for faster image processing and similarity detection.

. Result Visualization: Visualizes results and performance insights through plots and graphs using Matplotlib.

# Technologies Used

. Python: Core language used for implementing the logic and processing workflows.

. PySpark: Employed for large-scale, distributed processing of the image dataset.
